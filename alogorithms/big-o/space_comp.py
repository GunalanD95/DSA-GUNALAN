# Space Complexity

'''
    Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. 
    If we need to create an array of size n,
    this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, 
    this will require O(n2) space.

# Time Complexity - O(n)

# Space Complexity - O(1)
