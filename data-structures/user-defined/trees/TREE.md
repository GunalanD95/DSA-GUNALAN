# What is a a tree?

## a tree is a data structure that consists of a root node and a set of child nodes.

## the root node is the top of the tree.
## the child nodes are the nodes that are below the root node.

# Types of trees
## binary tree
## binary search tree
## binary heap
## binary tree of linked lists

### A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each vertex has only up to 2 children that satisfies BST property: All vertices in the left subtree of a vertex must hold a value smaller than its own and all vertices in the right subtree of a vertex must hold a value larger than its own (we have assumption that all values are distinct integers in this visualization and small tweak is needed to cater for duplicates/non integer). Try clicking Search(7) for a sample animation on searching a random value âˆˆ [1..99] in the random BST above.
